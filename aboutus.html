<p>We here at Brokers, as our name implies, serve as an intermediary between those who want to make trades and invest and the exchange in which those trades are processed.</p>



<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<p>  You need Brokers because, stock exchanges require that those who execute trades on the exchange be licensed. Another reason is a broker ensures a smooth trading experience between an investor and an exchange and, as is the case with discount brokers, usually won't charge a commission for normal trades.</p>



<h1>Expert Reviews</h1>
<p>A broker facilitates trades between individuals/companies and the exchanges where the broker is licensed. Depending on the nature of the trade and marketplace, a broker can either be a human being who is processing the trade themselves or a computer program that is only monitored by a human. Typically, stock trades are computerized whereas something like real estate requires a more personal touch.</p>
<p>We look forward to partnering and doing amazing things together. Thank you for doing business with us.</p>
